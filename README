#kohahack12 - solr/zebra team

goal: think and begin to write a search layer to provide to koha the choice between two (or more) searchengines (exemple: Zebra - because it is here - and Solr)

What's next?
- Moose mock et tests
- encapsulate configuration data in an object
- encapsulate db access in a specific data layer
- pod doc and koha community share
- transform naming in a more clear words to deferentiate "objects" from "business logic" from "data access"
- discuss to integrate a Data::SearchEngine::Zebra inside
